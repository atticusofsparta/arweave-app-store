# Arweave App Store
Mobile app store moderated with a community dao to rate trust and quality of apps, with app software stored and installed from arweave

## Why?

  Currently the google play store and apple store censor apps their investors dont like. This results in the promotion of apps that specifically benifits their shareholders. Some apps are even restricted geographically. Currently there are options such as F-Droid, that dont use a permanent storage solution and are able to be shut down.
  
## How

The idea behind the app store is to come pre-installed on ArOS devices in place of the google play store. Its your gateway in the world of arweave. When builders want their app listed on the app stored, they upload their software to arweave tagged with the appropriate categories for the app-store. The app store will automatically search for all apps when a user performs a search. The way in which the results of that search a filtered is twofold. First, the search queries the daos dapp registry, these results are returned first. Then, the rest of the results are returned. These are the results not in the registry, meaning they are the apps with no votes. 

## Moderation

For dapps both in the registry and not, they will have a forum thread created for them the first time someone comments about them. When you view an app the store queries for the forum thread on that app and returns its data. Users can upvote or downvote apps to show quality of them.
